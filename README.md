It's a sign language recognition system capable of converting hand gestures, commonly used in sign language, into meaningful text and speech.
our project aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities.
Users can interact with the system using their hand gestures, and our Python-based application will recognize and interpret these gestures, transforming them into accurate textual representations and even converting them into speech.
This project serves as a valuable tool for facilitating communication and fostering inclusivity, making it easier for individuals with hearing impairments to express themselves effectively in a world that often struggles to accommodate their unique needs.
